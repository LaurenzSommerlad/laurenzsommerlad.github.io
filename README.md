## About Me ##
I love building things and connecting with people. I learned programming at 12, founded a student-led startup at 15, and joined a technical high school majoring in CS & Math.

- 📚 I'm in my second year of Computer Science & Econ ([Information Systems](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/information-systems-bachelor-of-science-bsc)) at <a href="https://www.tum.de" target="_blank"><img src= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Logo_of_the_Technical_University_of_Munich.svg/816px-Logo_of_the_Technical_University_of_Munich.svg.png" width="25"></a> - The Technical University of Munich
- 🚀 I'm the Head of Venture Department at <a href="https://www.tum-ai.com" target="_blank">TUM.ai</a> organizing the <a href="https://www.tum-ai.com/e-lab" target="_blank">AI E-Lab</a>, a 14-week equity-free AI startup incubator. Our alumni are raising millions in pre-seed funding and have been accepted into Y Combinator, EWOR, CDTM and other prestigious programs from our partners and the Munich Entrepreneurship Ecosystem
- 🔭 I'm conducting research at <a href="https://www.ccrc-hauner.de/" target="_blank">LMU Hospital</a> to predict rare child diseases using federated learning-based Graph ML techniques on patient phenotypes, genes, and proteins
- 🤖 I'm developing perception and path planning software for an Autonomous Mars Rover for the European Rover Challenge 2024 with <a href="https://warr.de/projects/spacerobotics/" target="_blank">WARR Space Robotics</a>, while also leading fundraising efforts for the hardware
- 🌱 I have over 2+ years of work experience as a Software Engineer in Full-Stack web-based applications (working student)

Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy doing a lot of different sports like weight training, martial arts (Wing Chun), marathons, technical and cave diving, wakeboarding, snowboarding, and preparing for my first Ironman. I am also in love with traveling, exploring foreign cultures and learning languages including French, Spanish, Japanese & Arabic which continues to enrich my life.

Driven by a desire to make the world a better place, I am committed to solving the most challenging problems with technology. Feel free to reach out — I am always up for a coffee and a good conversation! ☕
